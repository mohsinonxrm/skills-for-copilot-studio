# Add Connector Action (Guide)

This skill guides users through adding a new connector action to their Copilot Studio agent. **It does NOT write action YAML directly** because connector actions require a connection reference that can only be created through the Copilot Studio UI.

## Why This Is a Guide, Not a Generator

Connector actions need:
1. A **connection reference** — an authenticated link to the external service (Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, etc.)
2. The connection reference can only be created by the user authenticating in the Copilot Studio portal
3. Once the action is added via the UI and pulled locally, the YAML can be edited with `/copilot-studio:edit-action`

## Connector Lookup

Help the user find the right connector and operation before they go to the UI. Use the connector lookup tool:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js list
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js operations <connector>
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js operation <connector> <operationId>
node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js search <keyword>
```

`<connector>` matches by API name (`shared_office365`) or partial display name (`outlook`).

Use these to help the user understand:
- Which connector has the operation they need
- What the operation is called (so they can find it in the UI)
- What inputs and outputs it expects

## Instructions

1. **Understand what the user wants** — ask clarifying questions if the request is vague (e.g., "send a message" — Teams? Outlook? Slack?)

2. **Search for the operation** using connector-lookup:
   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js search "<user's description>"
   ```
   If no match, try broader terms. Show the user what's available.

3. **Show the operation details** so the user knows exactly what to look for in the UI:
   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/connector-lookup.bundle.js operation <connector> <operationId>
   ```

4. **Walk the user through the UI steps**:

   > Here's how to add this action in Copilot Studio:
   >
   > 1. Open [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
   > 2. Navigate to your agent
   > 3. Go to **Actions** in the left sidebar
   > 4. Click **+ Add an action**
   > 5. Search for "**{operation displayName}**" from the **{connector displayName}** connector
   > 6. Configure the connection (authenticate with your credentials)
   > 7. Save the action
   >
   > Once saved, pull the updated agent files using the **Copilot Studio VS Code Extension** (Source Control → Pull).

5. **After the user confirms they've pulled**, check for the new action file:
   ```
   Glob: **/actions/*.mcs.yml
   ```
   If the action file is present, let the user know it was pulled successfully.

6. **Offer to edit the action** — if the user wants to customize inputs, descriptions, or connection mode:

   > Would you like me to edit the action YAML? I can modify input descriptions, switch between automatic and manual inputs, change the connection mode, and more. Just say the word and I'll use `/copilot-studio:edit-action`.

## Reference Catalog

For curated examples of well-structured actions (Teams post message, Outlook create event), see:

These samples show best practices for how actions should be structured and can serve as reference when editing actions.
