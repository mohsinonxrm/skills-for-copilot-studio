# Knowledge Architecture & Best Practices

Detailed guidance on how knowledge retrieval works, source selection, content quality, security, maintenance, and advanced patterns.

## How Knowledge Works

### Retrieval Pipeline
When a user sends a message, Copilot Studio:
1. **Splits** each knowledge source into overlapping text chunks at index time
2. **Embeds** the user's query and all chunks as vectors
3. **Ranks** chunks by semantic similarity to the query
4. **Passes** the top-ranked chunks as context into the language model
5. **Generates** a response grounded in those chunks, with citations

The quality of the answer depends on: chunk relevance, document structure, and the `instructions` field guiding the model's behavior.

### Automatic vs Explicit Retrieval
Copilot Studio has two modes:

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Automatic** (`GenerativeActionsEnabled: true`) | The orchestrator decides when to search knowledge based on the user's message. No topic needed for simple Q&A. |
| **Explicit** (via `SearchAndSummarizeContent` node) | A topic explicitly triggers a knowledge search. Use when you need to control which sources are searched, scope the query, or process the result before sending. |

For most agents, automatic mode is sufficient. Add explicit topics only when you need flow control or source scoping.

### The UniversalSearchTool
When the orchestrator detects a knowledge search intent in the user's message, it calls a single internal tool: **`UniversalSearchTool`**.

**How it works:**
- It searches **all configured knowledge sources** simultaneously, regardless of their type (public website, SharePoint, Dataverse, uploaded files, AI Search, etc.)
- It returns the best-matching results for the query — the number of results surfaced is controlled by the **Content Moderation slider** in the agent's Generative AI settings (higher = more results included, lower = more selective)
- The orchestrator then passes those results to the language model to generate the final grounded answer

**The 25-source limit:**
- `UniversalSearchTool` supports up to **25 knowledge sources**
- If the agent has **≤ 25 sources**: all sources are always searched on every call
- If the agent has **> 25 sources**: the orchestrator **selects up to 25 sources** that best match the search intent — the selection is driven by each knowledge source's **`# Name:` and description comment**

**Implication for authoring:**
- **Line 1 (`# Name:`)** is the display name shown in the Copilot Studio UI
- **Line 2 (plain comment)** is the description of the knowledge source — no `Description:` prefix, just the text directly (e.g. `# HR leave policies and employee entitlements`). This is what the orchestrator reads to decide which sources to include when the agent exceeds 25 sources. Write it to clearly describe the subject matter covered
- Vague or missing descriptions cause sources to be deprioritized for relevant queries when the agent exceeds 25 sources

## Knowledge Best Practices

### Source Selection
- Use **PublicSiteSearchSource** for publicly accessible websites (docs, marketing sites, FAQs)
- Use **SharePointSearchSource** for internal company content
- Use **GraphConnectorSearchSource** for enterprise systems indexed via Microsoft Graph connectors (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, custom connectors, etc.) — see below
- All other types (Dataverse, AI Search, uploaded files, SQL) must be configured via the Copilot Studio UI

### Graph Connector Knowledge Sources

Microsoft Graph connectors index content from enterprise systems into the Microsoft 365 index, making it searchable by Copilot Studio agents. Examples: ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, Azure DevOps, or any custom connector registered in the M365 admin center.

**Prerequisites — cannot be done in YAML:**
1. The Graph connector must be registered and enabled in the **M365 admin center** (Search & Intelligence → Data Sources)
2. The connector's `connectionId` must be stored as a **Power Platform environment variable** in the solution — this is the value referenced in the YAML

**YAML structure:**
```yaml
# Name: ServiceNow Knowledge Base
# ServiceNow tickets and knowledge articles indexed via Microsoft Graph connector.
kind: KnowledgeSourceConfiguration
source:
  kind: GraphConnectorSearchSource
  connectionId:
    schemaName: cr123_GraphConnectorId_ServiceNow   # Power Platform environment variable
  connectionName: servicenow-connection             # Logical name from M365 admin center
  contentSourceDisplayName: ServiceNow              # Shown in citations
  publisherName: ServiceNow
```

**Key fields:**
- `connectionId.schemaName` — references a Power Platform environment variable (not a raw GUID). Read the variable's schema name from the solution's environment variables or the Copilot Studio UI after the connector is added.
- `connectionName` — the logical name of the Graph connection as registered in M365 admin center
- `contentSourceDisplayName` — the label shown on citations in the agent's answers
- `publisherName` — optional; shown in the Copilot Studio UI
- `triggerCondition` — supported; use `=false` to opt out of automatic `UniversalSearchTool` searches

Use the template at `templates/knowledge/graph-connector.knowledge.mcs.yml`.

### Naming & Organization
- **Line 1 — `# Name:`** — the display name shown in the Copilot Studio UI
- **Line 2 — plain comment** — the description of the knowledge source (no `Description:` prefix, just the text directly). This is what the orchestrator's `UniversalSearchTool` reads to decide which sources to include when the agent has more than 25 knowledge sources. Write it to clearly describe the subject matter covered: `# HR leave policies and employee entitlements` is better than `# HR docs`
- Use one knowledge source per distinct content domain (e.g. one for HR policies, one for IT docs)
- Avoid overlapping sources covering the same content — it degrades answer quality
- Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated filenames: `hr-policies.knowledge.mcs.yml` not `ks1.knowledge.mcs.yml`

### URL Guidelines
**Public websites:**
- Provide the most specific URL that covers the needed content (e.g. `https://docs.example.com/products/` not `https://example.com/`)
- The site must be publicly crawlable — no login required
- Avoid URLs that return dynamic content or require JavaScript rendering
- Subdomains are treated as separate sources; add them individually if needed

**SharePoint:**
- Use the deepest folder path that covers the needed documents (avoid sharing the root site)
- Encode spaces as `%20` in the URL
- Supported document types: PDF, Word (.docx), PowerPoint (.pptx), plain text
- Ensure the agent's service account has read access to the SharePoint site
- Example: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Shared%20Documents/Policies`

### Content Quality
- Documents should have clear headings and titles — Copilot Studio uses these for chunking and citation
- Avoid sources that are mostly tables, images, or charts with no surrounding text — they produce poor answers
- Scanned PDFs without OCR text are not searchable — ensure PDFs have selectable text
- Keep documents focused on a single topic — a full company handbook produces lower-quality answers than individual policy documents
- Avoid duplicate content across multiple documents — it confuses relevance ranking
- Short documents (< 1 page) may not provide enough context; consider combining related short docs

### Quantity & Quality
- Keep the number of knowledge sources reasonable (ideally ≤ 10 per agent) — too many degrade relevance ranking
- Prefer narrower, well-scoped sources over broad ones
- Test knowledge sources with representative user queries after adding them

### Security Considerations
- **SharePoint**: the agent uses a service account — all users receive answers from all content the service account can access, regardless of the user's own SharePoint permissions
- Do not index folders containing confidential or restricted documents unless every user of the agent is authorized to see them
- For multi-audience agents (e.g. HR + general staff), use separate knowledge sources per audience and control access at the topic level

### Maintenance
- Public websites are re-crawled periodically — URL changes silently break indexing; monitor source URLs for redirects or removal
- SharePoint: new files added to the indexed folder are picked up automatically; renaming or moving files breaks existing citations
- Review all knowledge sources quarterly — remove or update stale sources to avoid outdated answers
- When a source URL changes, update the YAML file and push via the VS Code extension; do not create a duplicate source

### Testing & Validation
- After adding a source, ask the agent a representative question to verify retrieval from the new source
- If the agent says "I don't have information about that", check: (1) URL is correct and accessible, (2) site is publicly crawlable or SharePoint permissions are in place, (3) content is text-based and not image-only
- Use multiple test queries per source — a single passing test is not sufficient
- Check that citations returned by the agent point to the expected documents

## Advanced Patterns

### `triggerCondition` — Controlling When a Source Is Searched

Every knowledge source supports an optional `triggerCondition` field (a Power Fx `BoolExpression`). The `UniversalSearchTool` only includes the source in a search when this condition evaluates to `true`.

**`triggerCondition: =false`** — the most important pattern. It permanently disables automatic search for this source. The orchestrator will never include it in the `UniversalSearchTool` automatically. This is useful for:

1. **Explicit topic-controlled search** — the source is only used when a topic explicitly references it in a `SearchAndSummarizeContent` node. Gives you full control over when and how the source is queried.

2. **Startup topic initialization** — a greeting or `OnConversationStart` topic sets a global variable (e.g. `Global.UserDepartment`), then other sources use that variable in their `triggerCondition` to activate conditionally.

3. **`OnKnowledgeRequested` topic** — a topic with this trigger fires every time the orchestrator calls the `UniversalSearchTool`. Combined with `triggerCondition: =false`, you can intercept all knowledge requests and route them through custom logic before the search runs.

```yaml
# Example: source only searched for HR department users
kind: KnowledgeSourceConfiguration
source:
  kind: SharePointSearchSource
  triggerCondition: =Global.UserDepartment = "HR"
  site: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/HR/Shared%20Documents
```

```yaml
# Example: source never auto-searched — only used when explicitly referenced in a topic
kind: KnowledgeSourceConfiguration
source:
  kind: SharePointSearchSource
  triggerCondition: =false
  site: https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Confidential/Shared%20Documents
```

### `OnKnowledgeRequested` Trigger

This trigger fires on a topic every time the orchestrator calls the `UniversalSearchTool` (i.e. every time a knowledge search intent is detected). Use it to:
- Intercept knowledge requests and run custom logic before or after the search
- Load context, set variables, or pre-process the query
- Route the search to specific knowledge sources based on user context

```yaml
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnKnowledgeRequested
  id: main
  actions:
    # Custom logic here — runs every time a knowledge search is triggered
    - kind: SearchAndSummarizeContent
      id: searchContent_REPLACE1
      variable: Topic.Answer
      userInput: =System.Activity.Text
      knowledgeSources:
        kind: SearchSpecificKnowledgeSources
        knowledgeSources:
          - <schemaName>.topic.<KnowledgeSourceName>
```

### Topic-Level Knowledge Control
- Use `triggerCondition: =false` on a knowledge source to opt it out of automatic `UniversalSearchTool` searches — it will only be used when explicitly referenced in a `SearchAndSummarizeContent` node
- Use the `knowledgeSourceIds` filter in a `SearchAndSummarizeContent` node to restrict search to specific sources for a given topic
- Use `OnKnowledgeRequested` to intercept all knowledge searches and apply custom routing or pre-processing
- If a topic must never use knowledge (e.g. pure transactional flows), explicitly avoid `SearchAndSummarizeContent` nodes in it
